Slide 4:
- Request Project at PMT, by filling the Project Request Template <link>
 

Slide 5:
- some "project specific fields" are predefined already in the Method (e.g. DANTE)
- remove screenshot of "attachments" view
- remark how "Inactive" state works (no items can be created any more)
- remove screenshot of "History" view

<new> before Slide 5:
- insert Visio-Drawing of Doug before we explain the Items
- explain how Items are related to each other
	- e.g. Issue for multiple Variants, then ROs derived from that Issue for one Variant each
	- e.g. ROs for several Structure Elements and/or Variants
	
<new> after Slide 5:
- Visio Drawing: one box for "Issue", three boxes for "ROs", focusing on the attribute "Variant"

Concept for Variants and DevPathes: - every trainee shall create a DevPath with 
his name from the A-Sample Checkpoint on mainline of Training project - every 
trainee shall create a ProjectVariant Item with his name
